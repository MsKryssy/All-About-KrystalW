# All-About-KrystalW
A professional portfolio of work by full stack web develop that will show improvements and add-ons.

This professional portfolio challenge was used to build in order to show what has been learned and will be added to over time. This will become my personal portfolio of work to showcase my skills and projects. I will continue to use what I learn to add to this portfolio. Using HTML and CSS information learned from the first few weeks of bootcamp, I've started from scratch.

* Divided portfolio into sections such as: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me.
* Added an updated picture of myself in my about me section.
* Included navigation links that functions, taking you to desired sections. 
* Utilized pictures from unsplash.com as placeholders for my projects until real projects can be added there.
* Styled page for multiple screen sizes.

      <p>
        My name is Krystal Richardson and I recently started coding as of March 2023.
        I am currently possessing skills to become a full stack web developer
        knowledgeable in CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Github, and VS Code. As an
        entrepreneur in the e-commerce industry, I constantly put ideas together
        in my head on how the website could be better. On different technology screens,
        the marketable approach is important, so I decided that coding is a
        great investment and a great start!

                    My name is Krystal Williams and I recently started coding as of March 2023.
                    I am currently possessing skills to become a full stack web developer
                    knowledgeable in CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Github, and VS Code. As an 
                    entrepreneur in the e-commerce industry, I constantly put ideas together
                    in my head on how the website could be better. On different technology screens, 
                    the marketable approach is important, so I decided that coding is a 
                    great investment and a great start!
